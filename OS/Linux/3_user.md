- System accounts are used by daemons to access files and directories. These will usually be disallowed from interactive login via shell or physical console login.

- Interactive accounts are used by end-users to access computing resources from either a shell or physical console login.


## Create a new user
```bash
adduser
```

## Disabling User Accounts
There are several methods to disable accounts on a system. These range from editing the /etc/passwd file by hand. Or even using the passwd command with the -lswitch. Both of these methods have one big drawback: if the user has ssh access and uses an RSA key for authentication, they can still login using this method.

Now letâ€™s use the chage command, changing the password expiry date to a previous date. Also, it may be good to make a note on the account as to why we disabled it.
```bash
chage -E 2005-10-01 bjones
```

## Manage Groups
```bash
chgrp
groupadd
groups
usermod # update account attributes
```
